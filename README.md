# Mortgage-Discrimination-Measure

Mortgage discrimination alters the distribution of investment, opportunity, and economic advantage—key contributors of health disparities. Leveraging Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, we assessed mortgage denial risk in 380 U.S. urban areas. We estimated the risks by census tract–relative to the urban-specific average—using a Bayesian spatial model with conditionally autoregressive distributions fitted with integrated nested Laplace approximation. This approach borrows information through spatial and non-spatial smoothing, resulting in stable estimates in the presence of sparse data. The method, publicly accessible, allows researchers to apply our approach, fostering deeper insights into mortgage lending discrimination and systematic neighborhood disinvestment.
